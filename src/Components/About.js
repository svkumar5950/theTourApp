            If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the wrong
            thing. That's crazy. Everything is happy if you choose to make it
            that way. There comes a nice little fluffer. A tree cannot be
            straight if it has a crooked trunk. Little short strokes. If you
            don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see.
            We're trying to teach you a technique here and how to use it. You
            can do anything here. So don't worry about it. We might as well make
            some Almighty mountains today as well, what the heck. Every
            highlight needs it's own personal shadow. In this world, everything
            can be happy. In your world you can create anything you desire. We
            must be quiet, soft and gentle. It's important to me that you're
            happy. See there, told you that would be easy. Let's put a touch
            more of the magic here. Play with the angles. A tree needs to be
            your friend if you're going to paint him. I spend a lot of time
            walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and
            little rabbits and stuff. Nice little clouds playing around in the
            sky. You gotta think like a tree. If I paint something, I don't want
            to have to explain what it is. Just think about these things in your
            mind - then bring them into your world. Let's do it again then, what
            the heck. This is the fun part Work on one thing at a time. Don't
            get carried away - we have plenty of time. Just beat the devil out
            of it. There we are. Every time you practice, you learn more.

            They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But
            sometimes I put even numbersâ€”just to upset the critics. We tell
            people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get
            everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to
            get you addicted. And I will hypnotize that just a little bit. Isn't
            it great to do something you can't fail at? It's cold, but it's
            beautiful. Just think about these things in your mind and drop em'
            on canvas. If you overwork it you become a cloud killer. There's
            nothing worse than a cloud killer. When things happen - enjoy them.
            They're little gifts. We don't have anything but happy trees here.
            La- da- da- da- dah. Just be happy. Put light against light - you
            have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the
            contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. You
            can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You have that
            power. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him.
            By now you should be quite happy about what's happening here. Use
            what happens naturally, don't fight it. Poor old tree. All those
            little son of a guns. There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a
            friend. But they're very easily killed. Clouds are delicate. This is
            where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's
            better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. In life
            you need colors. Just beat the devil out of it. Let your imagination
            just wonder around when you're doing these things.
